This is for a hypothetical login page. It was really difficult to figure out how to get it to work.
I'm not entirely sure it did. I understand Cucumber and Gherkin no problem, but I think something
about Java made it really picky. I thought maybe it had something to do with the project structure,
but I kept recreating the project, and getting the same results. It could also have something to do
with my computer.
